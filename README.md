# Social-Network-Ads-Decision-Tree-Classifier

#Project Description:

The "Social Network Ads Decision Tree Classifier" project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict user engagement with social network advertisements. The project utilizes a decision tree classifier to analyze demographic and behavioral data, including age, gender, and estimated salary, extracted from user interactions with social network ads. By training the classifier on historical data, it learns to predict whether a user is likely to make a purchase based on these factors.

#The main objectives of this project include:

Preprocessing and encoding categorical data (e.g., gender) for use in machine learning models.
Implementing a decision tree classifier to model user behavior and predict purchase decisions.
Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy to assess its effectiveness in predicting user engagement with ads.
Through this project, insights can be gained into which demographic segments are more responsive to social network ads, aiding marketers in targeting their campaigns more effectively.
